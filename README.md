Japanese-English Flash Cards App

This is an app for learning Japanese Hiragana, Katakana, and some Kanji using Flash cards.
The app is written in C# using the Godot Game Engine Version 3.5.
As a hobby I am currently learning Japanese for fun while also learning to code in C# and learning how to make game apps using Godot.
So this project hits 3 birds with 1 stone.
